### Step 1: index.html
 Went through the index.html file and updated all of the &lt;div&gt; tags to appropriate semantic HTML and then cleaned up any empty lines to enhance readability.

### Step 2: style.css
  Updated the style.css sheet as the new tags needed to be re-linked.  Deleted empty lines and consolidated rules to enhance readability.
